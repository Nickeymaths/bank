Why TLS:
- authentication: asymmetric cryptography
- confidentiality: symmetric cryptography
- Integrity: message authentication code

cipher suite = set of algorithm that help secure a network connection
cipher suite = key exchange alg, bulk encrypt alg, message authen code

G
SSL: Secure Socket Layer
TLS: Transport Layer Secure
MAC: message authentication code
HMAC: hashed-based MAC
GMAC:
POLY1305:
DHE: Diffie Hellman Ephemeral
SHA: Secure Hashing Algorithm
RSA: 
EEC: Elliptic-Curve Cryptography
ECDHE: Elliptic-Curve Diffie Hellman Ephemeral
AEAD: Authentication encrypted association data
KFD: Key derivation function
HKDF: HMAC key derivation function
IKM: Input key material
CHACHA20:
Nonce: authenticate user khi encrypt message
AES-256-GCM: Advanced Encryption Standard Galois/Counter Mode
Bulk encryption
Module exponential problem
Discreate logarithm problem

Q
Authentication vs Authorization
Encrypted vs encode
Symmetric vs Asymmetric Cryptographic alg
- Symmetric: Authentication. E.g. ECS-256gcm, CHACHA20
- Asymmetric: Key exchange. E.g. DHE, ECDHE
What is salt?
How shared key is exchanged safely? Diffie-Hellman alg?
What is g primitive root module n: if all coprime of n is congruent with some
g^k.
What is module exponential problem?
What does ephemeral mean? Ephemeral key: Use different key in each session (temporary)
What does DHE mean? Use Diffie-Hellman + Ephemeral key (short-lived key)
What is ECDHE? Use elliptic-curve trapdoor function instead of module-based
like RSA. But Shor/s alg can break ECC by quantum computer easier than RSA.
